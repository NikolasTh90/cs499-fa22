# Demystifying Git and GitHub

*Git* is the software that allows us to do version control

- Git tracks changes to your source code so that you don‚Äôt lose any history of your project

*Github* is an online platform where developers host their source code (and can share it the world)

- You can host remote repositories on https://github.com/
- You edit and work on your content in your local repository on your computer, and then you send your changes to the remote

---

# Why you should use Git

To be kind to yourself

To be kind to your collaborators

To ensure your work is reproducible

## Spillover benefits

üë©‚Äçüî¨ üìê It imposes a certain discipline to your programming.

ü§ì üî• You can be braver when you code: if your new feature breaks, you can revert back to a version that worked!

# Workflow

---
# Workflow

- Clone the repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/walice/git-tutorial.git
   ```

- Work on `penguins.R`

- Stage your files

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

- Commit your changes

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add example code"
   ```

- Push your changes

   ```bash
   git push
   ```

---

# More command line tips

---

# Tell Git who you are

As a first-time set up, you need to tell Git who you are.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your name"
git config --global user.email "alice@example.com"
```

---

# git status

Use this to check at what stage of the workflow you are at

- You have made some local modifications, but haven't staged your changes yet

```bash
git status
```

```bash
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
         modified:   penguins.R
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

---

# git pull

Use this to fetch changes from the remote and to merge them in to your local repository

- Your collaborators have been adding some awesome content to the repository, and you want to fetch their changes from the remote and update your local repository

```bash
git pull
```

- What this is doing under-the-hood is running a git fetch and then git merge.


---

# Adding and ignoring files

To stage specific files in your repository, you can name them directly

```bash
git add penguins.R other-script.R
```

or you can add all of them at once

```bash
git add .
```

You might want to not track certain files in your local repository, e.g., sensitive files such as credentials. But it might get tedious to type out each file that you do want to include by name.

Use a `.gitignore` file to specify files to always ignore.

Create a file called `.gitignore` and place it in your repo. The content of the file should include the names of the files that you want Git to not track.

---

# git log

Use this to look at the history of your repository.

Each commit has a specific hash that identifies it.

git log
commit af58f79bfa4301643025dd6c8767e65349cf407a
Author: Name <Email address>
Date:   DD-MM-YYYY
    Add penguin script
You can also find this on GitHub, by going to github.com/user-name/repo-name/commits.

You can go back in time to a specific commit, if you know its reference.

---

# Undoing mistakes

Imagine you did some work, committed the changes, and pushed them to the remote repo. But you'd like to undo those changes.

Running git revert is a "soft undo".

Say you added some plain text by mistake to penguins.R. Running git revert will do the opposite of what you just did (i.e., remove the plain text) and create a new commit. You can then git push this to the remote.

```bash
git revert <hash-of-the-commit-you-want-to-undo>
git push
```

---
# Undoing mistakes

git revert is the safest option to use.

It will preserve the history of your commits.

```bash
git log
commit 6634a076212fb7bac16f9525feae1e83e0f200ca
Author: Name <Email address>
Date:   DD-MM-YYYY
     Revert "Add plain text to code by mistake"
     This reverts commit a8cf7c2592273ef6a28920222a92847794275868.
